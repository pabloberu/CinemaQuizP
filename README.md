## ‚ùì FAQ

#### + Will there be more updates?

-- Cinema Quiz was born as a simple project to learn and show knowledge, but we don't rule out working on new features for a 2.0 version.

Also, we would feel very flattered if our first project is an inspiration for others who are starting in the wonderful world of JavaScript
